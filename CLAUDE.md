## Architecture

### Stack
- **SwiftUI** with UIKit bridges where needed
- **Drawing engine:** custom UIKit canvas (`DrawingEngine.swift`)
- **Stamps:** UIKit layer (`StampCanvas.swift`) embedded in SwiftUI via `UIViewRepresentable`
- **Auth:** Sign In with Apple via `SnoodleAuthManager`
- **Backend:** Firebase Firestore, Firebase Storage, FCM push notifications

### Backend
- **Firebase Firestore** — community gallery (`world_gallery` collection), user profiles (`users`), follows, likes, comments, notifications
- **Firebase Storage** — doodle images at `world_doodles/`, profile photos at `profile_photos/`
- **Firebase Auth** — Apple Sign-In only

### Key Singletons (ObservableObject)
- `WorldGalleryManager.shared` — all community feed state, pagination, queries
- `SnoodleAuthManager.shared` — auth state, Apple Sign-In
- `SnoodleStore.shared` — local private doodle persistence (UserDefaults metadata + disk image files)
- `UserProfileManager.shared` — fetches/caches user profiles in batches of 30
- `FollowManager.shared` — follow/unfollow, feed
- `NotificationManager.shared` — FCM push notifications

### Tab Structure (ContentView.swift)
0. Gallery (GalleryTab) — community + private gallery
1. Calendar (CalendarTab) — private doodles by date
2. New (DrawScreen) — drawing canvas
3. Settings (SettingsTab)
4. Profile (ProfileTab → PublicProfileView)

## Pagination & Filtering

### FeedQuery enum (WorldGalleryManager)
```swift
enum FeedQuery { case everyone, artist(String), following([String]), search(String) }
```

### How pagination works
- **everyone / artist**: cursor-based using `lastDocumentSnapshot` + `start(afterDocument:)`
- **following**: timestamp-based (`whereField("timestamp", isLessThan: lastTimestamp)`) because batched `in` queries can't share a single Firestore cursor. Fetches in batches of 30 userIds.

### Firestore composite index (already exists, sufficient for all queries)
`world_gallery`: `userId ASC, timestamp DESC, __name__ DESC` — Status: Enabled

### searchIndex field
All `world_gallery` docs have a `searchIndex` array field (lowercased caption words + keywords combined). Search routes through Firebase `array-contains` on the first query term; additional words are filtered client-side from results. Backfill of old docs was run once via SettingsTab Debug button (b4).

### Search pagination
`.search(String)` uses cursor-based pagination (`lastDocumentSnapshot` + `start(afterDocument:)`), same as `.everyone` and `.artist`.

### Firestore composite indexes (both enabled)
- `world_gallery`: `userId ASC, timestamp DESC, __name__ DESC`
- `world_gallery`: `searchIndex ARRAYS, timestamp DESC` — for search queries

---

## Bugs Fixed in v1.9

### 1. Following feed pagination stopped at 20
**Root cause:** `fetchFollowing()` never stored `lastDocumentSnapshot`, so `fetchNextPage()` had no cursor.  
**Fix:** Switched following pagination to timestamp-based (`timestamp < lastTimestamp`) in `fetchNextPage()`.

### 2. Search detail view showed everything
**Root cause:** `WorldSnoodleDetailView.entries` overrode `initialEntries` with unfiltered `worldManager.sortedEntries`.  
**Fix:** Added `textFilter: String?` param to `WorldSnoodleDetailView`; `entries` computed property applies it. `GalleryTab` passes the active query text when opening detail.

### 3. searchIndex added to submit()
New submissions now write `searchIndex` to Firestore for future scalable text search.

---

## Bugs Fixed in v1.9 b4

### 1. Search detail view total count changed mid-swipe
**Root cause:** `WorldSnoodleDetailView.entries` used `worldManager.sortedEntries` as base even when `textFilter` was active. As swiping triggered pagination, newly loaded entries matching the search term were added to the filtered set, changing the count (e.g. 5 → 8 → 9).  
**Fix:** When `textFilter` is set, lock to `initialEntries` instead of live manager entries. Live entries are only used for the unfiltered case.

### 2. Stamp drag not undoable
**Root cause:** `handleDrag` in `StampCanvas.swift` updated stamp position directly with no undo snapshot.  
**Fix:** Push undo snapshot on the first drag event (when `draggingId` is nil), before any position change.

### 3. Search was client-side only (saw 3 results instead of full database)
**Root cause:** Search filtered only the 20 loaded entries, not the full Firestore collection.  
**Fix:** Added `FeedQuery.search(String)` case routed through Firebase `array-contains` on `searchIndex`. Added Firestore composite index (`searchIndex ARRAYS + timestamp DESC`). Backfilled `searchIndex` on all 141 existing docs via one-time admin function. `GalleryTab` debounces 400ms then fires Firebase query; clears back to prior feed mode when search is cleared.

### 4. Provisioning profile conflict
**Root cause:** Old provisioning profile "Skadoodle Development" for `com.eddiebrayman.skadoodle` was cached and blocked Debug builds after bundle ID changed to `maxsdad.skadoodle`.  
**Fix:** Deleted old profile from developer.apple.com, downloaded fresh profiles in Xcode Settings → Accounts, re-enabled Automatically manage signing.

## New in v2.0

### Text Stamp Overhaul
- **12 fonts** — Default, Rounded, Serif, Mono, Handwriting, Futura, Typewriter, Avenir, Chalkboard, Didot, Marker, Gill Sans
- **Bold / Italic toggles** — independent B and I buttons; combining both gives bold italic. Replaces old R/B/I/BI radio.
- **Text alignment** — left / center / right per stamp
- **WYSIWYG composer** — combined input/preview: TextEditor styled with the selected font/color/background, always visible above the keyboard. Controls scroll below; Place button pinned via `.safeAreaInset`.
- **`PlacedStamp` new fields:** `fontStyle: String` ("regular"/"bold"/"italic"/"bolditalic"), `textAlignment: String` ("left"/"center"/"right")
- All four render paths updated: live UILabel (`StampCanvas.updateVisual`), cached UIImage (`StampCanvas.renderImage`), final export (`renderCanvasWithStamps`), share card (`DrawScreen`)
- Cache key includes `fontStyle` and `textAlignment` to prevent stale cache hits

### Other 2.0 fixes (carried from 1.9.x work)
- Artist strip no longer flickers — `topArtistEntries` only written by `fetchTopArtistEntries()`, not reset on refresh
- Profile grid raised from 50 to 200 doodle limit; blank tiles fixed by switching to `RetryAsyncImage`
- World gallery share card always saves correct doodle (cleared `loadedWorldImage` on swipe)
- Update alert false-suppression fixed — dismissal key is now `"current->store"` pair
- Text stamp padding tightened: `hPadding: 10, vPadding: 5`

## Outstanding Items (for next version)

### Recommended fixes
1. **`@StateObject` on singletons** — Multiple views use `@StateObject` with `.shared` singletons. Should be `@ObservedObject`. Affects: `DrawScreen`, `GalleryTab` (5 places), `ProfileView`, `StampTools`.
2. **`fetchCommunityCount()` in SettingsTab** — Downloads all documents to count; should use Firestore `.count.getAggregation()` instead.
3. **`deleteAccount()` swallows all errors silently** — User sees success even if Firebase deletes partially fail.

### Low priority / style
- `ProfileView.swift:409-410` — `.presentationDetents` / `.presentationDragIndicator` after `.fullScreenCover` are dead code.
- `fetchPublicDoodles` does redundant client-side sort after ordered Firebase query.
- APNs watchdog timer in `snoodleApp.swift` captures `self` without `[weak self]` (benign since AppDelegate has app lifetime).

## Architecture Rules (critical — follow strictly)
- **NEVER touch working code** unless it is directly related to the bug or feature being worked on
- **Always ask before making changes outside the stated scope**
- **Every build is treated as final/shippable** — no speculative changes
- **All data operations must be scalable** — no loading entire collections into memory
- **Firestore queries only** — never filter server data client-side
- Pagination page size: **20**
- WorldSnoodle images are stored in Firebase Storage; URLs stored as `imageURL` in Firestore docs
- Private doodles use `SnoodleStore` (UserDefaults metadata + `Documents/Doodles/` image files on disk)

---

## Development Workflow
- Project folder connected at `/Users/edwardbrayman/Development/Active/Skadoodle`
- Eddie works in Claude Desktop / Cowork mode (moved away from zip file workflow due to code regression issues)
- Single-file edits preferred; always verify changes compile before flagging as done
- Be direct about uncertainty rather than guessing
